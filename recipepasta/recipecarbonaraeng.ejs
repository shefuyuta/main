            <li>40g of salt(1% of water)</li>
            </ul></div>
            <h3>[For Sauce]</h3>
            <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
            <li>30ml of olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>200g of Guanciale(pancetta or bacon can be substitutes)</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>2 Egg york</li>

            <li>A pinch of black pepper</li>
            <li>50g of pecolino romano(parmigiano reggiano can be substitute)</li>
          </ul></div>
      <h2>-Process-</h2>
        <div class="process">
          <ul>
          <li>Squash garlic cloves, get rid of its peel and roots, and slice them.</li>
          <li>Chop guanciale thinly so that it's gonna be easy to make it crispy.</li>
          <li>Put 1 egg and 2 egg yorks in a bowl and mix it well.</li>
          <li>Grate cheese on it, add salt and black pepper, and mix well again.</li>
          <li>Put chopped garlic and olive oil on a pan, then heat it on with middle heat.</li>
          <li>Wait until you can see bubbles around garlic cloves, slant your pan a little bit to deep-fry garlic cloves.</li>
            <a>For who uses IH cooker, heat on your pan with high heat.
            <br>Slanted your pan after you see bubbles. And put your pan back on IH cooker when the bubbles are gone.
            <br>Repeat this process 2 to 3 times.</a>
          <li>Start heating on water, then boil pasta.I recommend to boil pasta for 2 minutes shorter than what the package says.
          <br>Preferably finish boiling pasta when sauce is done.</li>
          <li>When nice smell of garlic pops up, add guanciale and grill it until it becomes crispy.</li>
            <a> 　(It's up to you how much you cook guanciale but ensure that garlic cloves are not burned.)</a>
          <li>Move boiled pasta into pan, also add 50ml of boiling water. Move your pan back and forth vigorously and mix pasta and sauce
            <br>If you can, flip your pan many times to mix it better.</li>
          <li>Keep mixing and feel the water you added and olive oil are mixed and getting some consistency.
          <li>Stop heating, wait for about 10 sec., and put pasta into the bowl. And mix immediately.</li>
           <a>Make sure to mix immediately otherwise the egg would congeal.</a>
          <li>Add extra salt, black pepper, and cheese if you like.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="remarks">
          <h3>[Remarks]</h3>
          <a>If you have only one cooker in your kitchen like me, in order to let the water be as hot as possible when you start boiling pasta,
          <br>boil water first while you cut ingredients. And start heating on them after the water is boiled.
          <br>Also after the pasta is boiled, heat on pasta sauce again before adding pasta in it.</a>
